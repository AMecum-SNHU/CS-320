I can help to ensure my code is functional and secure by keeping it modular, syntactically correct, and using appropriate data structures.  The code can then be tested each time a section is built, ensuring the new portion is functioning appropriately.

	User needs requirements are the end-user requirements for a system.  These can range from requirements explained by the client to comfort (such as a design that is not hard on the eyes).  For the former, itâ€™s simple enough to do what they ask for, asking clarification when needed.  For the latter, you can still ask the client, using your best judgement when necessary, then making changes based on the feedback you receive.  Much of this also applies to designing software.
